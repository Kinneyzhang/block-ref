** Introduction
   Block-ref and block-embed are two concepts in [[https://roamresearch.com][Roam Research]]. With the two functionalities, users can easily refer or include one block in another block or page. Roam-block has implemented these in emacs.
   
   What's the differences between block-ref and block-embed? Block-ref means a reference refers to a block, while block-embed embed one block in any place. When you change the content of the original block, both of the block-ref and block-embed content could be synchronized. But, there're some differences.

   For block-ref, you cannot change the content of it because it's actually a reference literally. This feature suits the situation where you don't want to change the block content any where but refer to the original one.

   For block-embed, you can change the content of any embed blocks and all the blocks which are derived from one original block will be synchronized.

** Installation

   Firstly, install the dependencies:

   - [[https://www.sqlite.org/index.html][sqlite3]] cli
   - [[https://github.com/emacsorphanage/ov][ov]] package
   - [[https://github.com/skeeto/emacsql][emacsql]] package
   - [[https://github.com/cireu/emacsql-sqlite3][emacsql-sqlite3]] package

   Then, clone roam-block repo to your local directory and add the following codes to your emacs configuration:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/roam-block/")
   (require 'roam-block)
   (setq roam-block-home '("~/roam-block/")
         roam-block-ref-highlight nil)
   (roam-block-mode 1)
   (define-key roam-block-mode-map (kbd "C-c b r c") #'roam-block-ref-store)
   (define-key roam-block-mode-map (kbd "C-c b r i") #'roam-block-ref-insert)
   (define-key roam-block-mode-map (kbd "C-c b r d") #'roam-block-ref-delete)
   (define-key roam-block-mode-map (kbd "C-c b r t") #'roam-block-ref-highlight-toggle)
   (define-key roam-block-mode-map (kbd "C-c b e c") #'roam-block-embed-store)
   (define-key roam-block-mode-map (kbd "C-c b e i") #'roam-block-embed-insert)
   #+END_SRC

   If you prefer =use-package=, use the following codes:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (use-package roam-block
     :load-path "path/to/roam-block/"
     :hook (after-init . roam-block-mode)
     :init (setq roam-block-home '("~/roam-block/")
                 roam-block-ref-highlight t)
     :bind
     (:map roam-block-mode-map
           (("C-c b r s" . roam-block-ref-store)
            ("C-c b r i" . roam-block-ref-insert)
            ("C-c b r d" . roam-block-ref-delete)
            ("C-c b r t" . roam-block-ref-highlight-toggle)
            ("C-c b e s" . roam-block-embed-store)
            ("C-c b e i" . roam-block-embed-insert))))
   #+END_SRC
